## The idea

It's an interface designed for a rapsberry pi touch screen module, to display essential information such as time, weather, tasks and agenda.

## What's under the hood

* Vue CLI 3
* Boostrap 4
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS
* APIs

## APIs

* [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* [Google Calendar](https://developers.google.com/calendar/)
* [Google Tasks](https://developers.google.com/tasks/)
* Still deciding on the clock one. :)

## Who's behind this??

Hi, I'm Morgana, I got my husband a raspberry pi 3 as a gift,but since he is not doing anything with it so far, I decided to make it help our morning routine, and since I am learning VueJs, I decided to build it using this framework.
